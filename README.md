# Ichnaea
Ichnaea is a lightweight interrupt-based tracer for dynamic memory objects. Ichnaea traces rich context information without sacrificing performance.
---
## Features
- Very-low overhead when objects arenâ€™t touched
- Traces Kernel Writes
- Traces multithreaded workloads
- Rich context per access (who wrote, where, what, when)
- Works with `LD_PRELOAD` and simple header annotations
- Fuzzer-friendly alternative to heavyweight tools like Pin or Valgrind
